The first problem will not output any errors. It will simply log Tesla, and then Mercedes.
The second problem will log "othername" but not "name" as name was redefined within the second block using a semi-colon.
The third problem will be undefined as "hashedPassword" was not defined within the first const. 
The fourth problem will print false as first is not equal to second but the second console log will print true as first is equal to third. 
The final problem will output all the values properly.
