The first problem will output Tesla then Mercedes. 
The second problem will not output anything and will result in an error due to "name" not being defined.
The third problem will output 12345 however will not output anything for "hashedPassword" as it is undefined.
The fourth problem will output false as the value "first" is equal to 2 and the value "second" is equal to 5. The second log will
output true as "first" is equal to 2 and "third" is equal to 2 as well.
The final problem will output 4 different values. The first being "value" which is what key is defined as. The second log will print out the array that "secondKey" is defined as ([1,5,1,8,3,3])
The third and fourth output will consist of the individual values set within the array. secondKey[0]; being 1, and "willThisWork" being 5
